## Problem Statement
As a traveler, flying can be a frustrating and long endeavor especially during peak period. We often need to face unforeseen circumstances such as long immigration line and flight delays, or worse, lost baggage. In order to save guard ourselves, we are taught to get a travel insurance in case any of these circumstances were to happen. However, on the other side of the fence, insurance companies face the difficult task of predicting the likelihood of these outcomes to happen. Take for example, if the insurance company able to predict if a flight will delay before it departs, they are able to set a competitive pricing for their insurance products. 

Therefore, in the project, I will be using dataset from Bureau Transportation of Statistics (USA) to predict if a flight will delay or on-time. As a rule of thumb in the aviation industry, a flight is considered delay when it arrived at the destination airport more than 15 minutes than the scheduled arrival time. My target variable (y-axis) will be 'arrdel15'.
